## Results
Based on the results of the US Outdoors category vine review analysis, I do not see a positivity bias as a slightly higher percentage of non-vine reviews were actually 5 star reviews. It is worth mentioning and considering the fact that a very small percentage of the total reviews were actually vine reviews. Because of this, repeat analysis within each other category, along with all categories in general, would give us a more clear understanding of positivity bias within the program.
